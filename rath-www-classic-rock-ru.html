So I've been wanting to do this for a long time but I was afraid that it might not take off at all, but I've talked to a few guys that were interested, and if it's only 5-10 guys that might be interested, that's enough for me :) I promise this will be interesting, our hip hop scene is the best in Europe after England, but very few know about it, but if you check out the artists and songs I post I promise you will realize that too! Even if you really don't care about our Hip Hop scene, at least. I joined the community in August 2018 and I thought I should give back.

Up next, she won’t be popping out a box as a surprise, it’s Lu ( u/lppereira )! Get to know Lu: My drag name is Lu. I'm 19 and I'm from Portugal. My drag name might be weird but it has a reason. When I'm with my best friends, they call me "Lu" and it's when I'm near them I feel like my most authentic self and because I believe that drag is the expression of your inner self, of your authentic self, I chose "Lu" as my drag name. I also thought about HalleLu/Halle Artist: Kacey Musgraves (https://imgur.com/sY3s3OJ) Album: Golden Hour (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5d/Album_Golden_Hour_cover.jpeg) Release Date: March 30, 2018 Genre: Country, Pop, Country Pop, Pop Country --- ##Artist Bio Did you know that Kacey was on the singing competition Nashville Star in 2006 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2fnrc9kWIs)? (Did you even know that that competition was a thing? I sure didn't!) She placed sixth, which is even worse. Looking to sell my SMITE account that I've had since beta, I don't play/have any interest in SMITE anymore.

Hey guys, I really enjoy music and I guess a lot you too, I wanted to start a little thread to share some of my favorite songs for each music category. Feel free to do the same as I I would recommend any of you to listen to genres and open your mind on music.

# Intro: Who Is Barbie? Understanding The Doll (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hhjjhYGQtY) I am, and have always been, a vocal Barbie apologist. When I was in high school I had a crush on a boy in my technical theatre class (at least I think I did, it was a weird time for me) and he invited me over to his family’s gym for his birthday and when I got there his little brother greeted me and then handed me an essay that he had printed out about how Barbie was terrible for society. Hi everyone, Until May 2018 I posted this on a regular basis (https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/8lvakf/5_months_of_adoption_nano_accepted_here_9/) since the adoption rate was high. Sometimes we had several new entries per day. Then adoption slowed down and also private work slowed me down. Also, USE NANO, https://usenano.org appeared and took over some of the work. usenano.org's listings do not fully match this list and vice versa. Both of us would need to invest Hello fellow spikes and happy holidays! Been a long time lurker here but I finally have a result I'm happy to report on. I've been off the walls busy until the holidays so I'm posting this pretttty late, but hey better late than never! # Decklist and Sideboard Guide: I played Caleb Scherer's latest 75 from his latest blogpost and followed his sb guide to the dot: https://adventuringgear.wordpress.com/2018/11/30/modern-storm-for-scg-baltimore/ (https://adventuringgear.wordpress.com/2018/11/3. </p>
