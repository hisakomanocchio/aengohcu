I live in a college dorm, and the internet has been slow/sketchy the past few days. I finally get around to hooking up my 360 today and it patched, but I've completely lost my single player game.

Решение проблем в Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction — не устанавливается? Не запускается? Тормозит? Вылетает? Лагает? Ошибка?. I hope I'm not suggesting already scrapped things but the act 2 nightmare defensive mercenary is getting out of hand and is becoming the only viable option in 90% of the builds as we're all aware. The main problem is that all mercenaries but act 2 ones do not have spells that affect you. The other problem is that Infinity is the final goal for a good portion of the cases (especially when it's build enabling for quite a few builds). Since we have melee splash jewels which add so much power.

Game of Thrones Patch Notes for Episode 5 1. Scorpions got nerfed. Significantly reduced accuracy. And the hero character Euron no longer gives a bonus to Scorpion accuracy. 2. Dragons got buffed. Speed and stealth have both been increased. They can now take the hide action while flying. 3. Dothraki have been added back to the game. Fans were upset about their removal, so they’re back now. 4. Battle Times have been shortened. Complaints that the Battle of Winterfell lasted Here are some extremely budget starter builds for Synthesis league. These builds are designed to function with just a tabula and some inexpensive uniques. To view the builds, you'll need to download Path of Building (https://github.com/Openarl/PathOfBuilding/releases). Each build has 4 trees to give you a suggested path to take while leveling. You can switch between the trees with the drop-down menu in the bottom bar (just to the left of the reset and import buttons). Reddit only allows us two stickies, so this is now two threads in one! Please post your MSPaint builds as comments here — new threads made for them will be removed and redirected to this thread. The compiled 3.6 info below is also still being updated, and I'll keep updating it until we know everything. ampnbsp; ampnbsp; Brand New Info (check this section daily to stay up to date) As far as I'm aware we now know everything.

Note - Before I type out my "controversial opinion" this does not reflect everyone's views (obviously) and I expect people to disagree and try to defend their school/association views. This is my opinion based on my personal Ethos/convictions I recently got a message from a friend who said "My school is going to white gi's only. I don't know how I feel about this." And this is after years of wearing whatever you want. It struck me as odd and I get some of the reasoning school owners. UPDATE 4: I've added a new section called "Strongholds." UPDATE 3: I've updated the introductory paragraphs. UPDATE 2: See my comment (https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/bbhe30/a_repository_of_useful_or_relevant_posts/ekt18hz/), below. UPDATE 1: I've added more links and created a new section called "Builds." amp#x200B; Hello all, amp#x200B; I'm compiling a list of posts that provide useful information, relevant ideas, and cool stuff. I've gone through every "Top" Heya all, Lots of progress this month with 11 games finished! This might get lengthy so I'll understand if you skip ahead to the end or skim it. :) Last month's progress (https://www.reddit.com/r/12in12/comments/b6pw7c/march_progress_going_well_but_work_gets_in_the_way/) I'll get the fluff out of the way with first: Abandoned: 0 Fortunately, no abandoned games this month, which means two months on the bounce with no abandonments. Additions: 16 A few additions as I re-subbed. 
We’ve had a bunch of posts lately about the difficult standard women in politics are held to. Here is yet another reminder that TiMs are not women: In 2012, Stacie Laughton was the first out trans woman to be elected to state legislator. Before serving, opposition research revealed that Laughton had not completed the conditions related to his felony conviction (https://patch.com/new-hampshire/nashua/it-s-final-laughton-to-resign#youtube_video-12379649) for credit card fraud. Hello /r/CompetitiveHS! After being surprised by a very early patch, we’ve got another surprise in a form of a second nerf patch during a single expansion, something that hasn’t happened since the game’s release. This time, however, I’ve passed up on the early report, since the first shifts in the meta weren’t big (and, to be honest, I’ve been really busy with other things). I’ve decided that a week is enough time to give meta some time to settle, so I can come with a solid report of the decks. Hello all, amp#x200B; I've compiled a list of posts on various topics that I hope others will find useful, relevant, or simply cool. The original repository can be found here (https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/bbhe30/a_repository_of_useful_or_relevant_posts/). I've replicated the post in its entirety below, however for the up-to-date list you'll have to head over to the original (current as of 4/21/19). All links are from r/AnthemTheGame; however, after browsing this subreddit. Seriously, her lack of ethics and professionalism continues to amaze me; every time we think she can't get any worse, she proves us wrong. In her most recent "interview" with fellow slanderer Ferak (https://patch.com/wisconsin/across-wi/amp/27942815/zellner-q-steven-averys-recent-court-victory), she is quoted as saying: gtIn the next 60 days the circuit court will rule on whether Mr. Avery’s conviction should be reversed. The judge, Angela Sutkiewicz, should recuse herself Introduction: Ryan Montgomery was born in 1977 in Detroit, Michigan where he would later be celebrated as the acclaimed rapper Royce Da 5’9”. Instead of regurgitating wikipedia articles I’ll give you my brief knowledge of and history with Royce. Like most people I have to assume, I discovered Royce through association with Eminem. In my mind Royce has been Shady’s right hand guy for a minute, notably due to their collaboration album Bad Meets Evil, and is responsible for holding 
I’m sure someone could write a whole dissertation on the double standards for male and female politicians. After all, here in the US we have a President well known for being vain, promiscuous, emotional and over-reliant on social media- any of which would have evoked nasty stereotypes in a female politician. But I’ve noticed that TiM politicians are still “allowed” to display these male patterns. For example, I read this morning that “non binary” Dundee Councillor Gregor Murray was thinking. I'm creating my very first character for a DnD campaign, but I've never considered myself a very creative person and would really appreciate some advice. I've DM'd exactly one session and have never played as a PC, so this is all new territory for me. I tried to include some possible NPCs for the DM (they're named in the long-form, 4-page backstory, but not the summary) and left the adventuring hook quite broad. I'm sure I hit a bunch of cliches along the way, but hopefully it's not too distract. Originally, this was meant to be the final part. ok, I lie. Originally this was meant to be the final part of the expanded version of the first chapter. It may still be. Or there may be a part 3 at some point. Time will tell. Part 1 is here (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bf5g9j/sundered_realms_crossover_chapter_1_introductions/), for those that want to read it. Wiki is here (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/sundered_realms). \-----------------------------------------------. 
So, another column of thoughts about the.welp. new meta now.as usual, easy to find topics, with a TL;DR at the end. This is more a reaction to the patch and its precedents, and I’ll have more deckbuilding meta thoughts in the near future. TGP told me to post this here, since it's less deck/meta related, but more meta-meta. OVERALL PATCH SENTIMENT—BUFFS GOOD, NERFS BAD: now, a heads up—a lot of criticism is going to take place in this post. But it isn’t because I’m necessarily disappo. Hello /r/hearthstone! After being surprised by a very early patch, we’ve got another surprise in a form of a second nerf patch during a single expansion, something that hasn’t happened since the game’s release. This time, however, I’ve passed up on the early report, since the first shifts in the meta weren’t big (and, to be honest, I’ve been really busy with other things). I’ve decided that a week is enough time to give meta some time to settle, so I can come with a solid report of the decks. </p>
