Bear in mind, this is my opinion and you may have your own, that does not make mine or yours wrong in any way. In my very personal opinion, this movie hits all of the notes I am looking for in a good film: touch of comedy and drama, some real-world themes, and nicely done character and story development. The seriousness of a lonely high school boy just trying to find a crowd he belongs to hits me right at home. The splash of comedy that Murphy brings alone as the enemy-turned-best-friend. 
Wealthy teenager Charlie Bartlett (Anton Yelchin) is failing miserably at fitting in at a new public high school run by the world-weary Principal Gardner (Robert Downey I think this movie was made low budget and totally independently. No movie stars I don't think. It was a comedy movie and the comedy was totally weird. I just can't think of any actual parts of the plot. I think he moves somewhere new and develops a crush. He might be living with extended family of some kind. maybe he moves to California. Maybe he breaks an arm or a leg during the movie. I'm not sure.

Remember the scene in "Juno" where Juno (Ellen Page) tells Paulie (Michael Cera) that he's cool without trying, and he heartbreakingly replies: "Actually, I try a lot"? Well, if that's true, the effort doesn't show, and that's precisely why Paulie's so cool, in his gentle, quietly geeky I think this film would be a good contender for the collection. Nobody I know has heard of it and it's probably one of my favorite movies. Great acting by the late Anton Yelchin and Robert Downey Jr. Solid story about a high schooler who provides therapy to other students and "prescribes" them medication. It's a great film, some really light hearted moments, but also reaches some dark places as well. It also doesn't have a blu ray release that I'm aware of. I've been waiting for years to upgrade.

in civil war, Tony's mom is played by Hope Davis. Downey Jr. and Davis have worked together before, in the film "Charlie Bartlett" in which Davis plays the wealthy and eccentric mother to the title character. In that movie, there is a scene where she sings along while a piano is being played, much like how she does in Civil War. This could be coincidental, but I really don't think so.

Charlie Bartlett movie reviews & Metacritic score: Charlie Bartlett, a wealthy, intelligent 17-year-old, has been kicked out of nearly every boarding school. I had no intentions of watching this film at all as I was scrolling through Netflix, but the cover and noticing Robert Downey Jr. was in the film caught my attention. Now an hour and 36 mins later, I have to say I loved it. It wasn't perfect but I found it easy to connect to and it's over glorified hero, Charlie Bartlett. Because as human beings I think everyone of us wants to be liked by other people (am I wrong in grossly-generalizing that!?). Сына богатеньких родителей Чарли Бартлетта к его совершеннолетию выгнали из всех элитных школ города. Очень уж своеобразное у юноши чувства юмора. Отчаявшиеся. Look for Aubrey Graham. Just a fun fact that I think people who have even seen the film might not have noticed. This is likely before he became a rapper.
