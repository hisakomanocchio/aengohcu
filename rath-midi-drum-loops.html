                            <p> Where’s the best place to buy Midi drums with good value? I mostly produce Pop but sometimes drift away to Hip-hop/Rock/RnB. Hello members of r/musicproduction I'm new here, stumbled in looking for a good place to ask music related questions. Hoping this place stays active and looking forward to sticking around and answering a few questions myself, provided I have the knowledge to do so. On to my current pursuit of knowledge. I'm wondering if anyone has experience in creating (or sequencing?) MIDI drum loops and if anyone knows of any user-friendly software (preferably free) that allows you to create MIDI drum loops. 
I have a bunch of midi drum loops, and I was wondering if there was some way to preview them via a browser somewhere inside Logic. Right now I end up dragging onto my drum track from the finder to preview, which is slow. Thanks. I hope the title makes sense. I'm a newb. I'd like to get to where I have paired up midi drum loops with audio bass and guitar tracks so that I can have the whole vertical slice be like one puzzle piece to move around. So I have Superior Drummer and I'm not really liking some of the drum loops that it comes with. I have a couple ideas in mind that I want to take a MIDI drum file and just modify it slightly. What are some places you'd go to for free drum loops? I'm just using it for a project so not worried about copyright, royalty etc. Style is rock/metal. 
Basically just want to trigger my own drum samples with MIDI. Seems like either EXS24 or Ultrabeat can do the trick, but I'm not sure which one would I've been trying to improve my drum programming skills, and I've been looking everywhere for MIDI loops geared towards EDM so I can "deconstruct" them, and understand how to better program my own rhythms. Seems the only MIDI's available are for EDM melodies/chords, but no one has made ones for drums. Or, on the other hand, if someone could recommend me a thorough tutorial on drum programming geared towards electro and progressive house, that would be awesome. Ableton Live has a loop option you can toggle for tracks, so if you expand the track it loops for the duration you set. Reaper does this by default. I need to do this in Cubase. I've watched many tutorials and cannot figure this out. An official tutorial told me to copy and paste: https://youtu.be/ZXL_w8rYhB8?t=3m52s But this is inefficient; if I need to make changes I'll have to copy and paste again. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Hey guys amp girls. I am trying to import midi drum loops in Logic to use with Kontakt. Whenever I import the file it opens up a bunch of software instruments and puts each drum part on a separate track. How do I assign the midi to work with the Kontakt track that I am trying to put it on. I'd like all the drum hits to be on a single track too so it's easier to manipulate the patterns. Any ideas. This is a Live set of 45 original midi drum loops of varying genre that I've compressed for free download. There are also recorded audio loops of cymbals to match the midi loops. This set was designed to be performed from top to bottom but each loops makes sense on its own as well. I really like this set, and figured you guys my like to use these loops as well. Follow the link below to hear these drum loops. Hey guys amp girls. I am trying to import midi drum loops in Logic to use with Kontakt. I managed to get the drums all in one track by holding down Command while dropping it in the arrange area. The problem though is that when I press play those midi files don't sound, since they are not triggering the Kontakt samples. I'm at a lost for how to do this part. I think it should be simple, but I just can't find specific info about this. Any ideas. Hi, is there any decent collection of midi drum loops available that i could download. How does one change the tempo of drum loops? I have attempted to freeze the track then change BPM in clip view but it sounds absolutely awful and doesn't adjust right. What is the proper Specifically, looking for drum loops recorded by an actual drummer, hopefully in funk/rock/punk/metal genres. I'm hoping to find things with a good sampling of ghost notes, bonus points if there are note on events for cymbals. thanks.

I'm trying to load a midi drum loop inside sunvox, but unfortunately when I play the file inside sunvox it doesn't play the midi file as drums, it just plays it as piano. Why is this happening? Please get back in touch as soon as possible with any help you can provide for this issue, thanks. So that they come up alongside the built in ones? Also do you know any sources for MIDI drum loops similar Hey, I have a bunch of MIDI drum loops that I want to use in my songs, however, I don't want to throw them all into my loops folder on Studio one (I don't like it) I was wondering If there was a VST that allows me to program drums and insert loops to select and hear. I have been using MT Power Drum kit, so If I can put it in there, it would be good if someone knew a way to input them into that VST. If not, suggest me one (best if free!). </p>
