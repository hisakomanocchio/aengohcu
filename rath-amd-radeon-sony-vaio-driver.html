                            <p>Hey fellas, I just upgraded from a 1050 Ti to a Nitro+ 580. Went with DDU to wipe the old drivers and just installed the card into my rig. Before going at it though I've got a couple of questions. What stuff do you guys use in terms of software? Do I still run Afterburner + Rivatuner? Or is there anything better for monitoring/overclocking? Only heard about Wattman but if I recall it comes with AMD's drivers. Or is that just for undervolting? Have never owned a Radeon GPU (other Hey all, I have a Sony Vaio laptop that I'm trying to fix, but haven't really had any progress. When you put it in sleep mode and wake it up, it gives you the BSOD, then goes to a black screen that says "Operating System not found". When you restart it, it runs just fine as long as it doesn't go into sleep mode. Here are the specs on it from dxdiag - amp#x200B; gtOperating System: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 17134) (17134.rs4\_release.180410-1804) gt gtLanguage: English. My Sony Vaio laptop \(Windows 10, 64bit\) is having quite some trouble when starting. Basically, when it is booted up, it loads, but instead of the login screen, the screen turns off after the Windows logo. It turns on again, then it shows the loading dots \(the ones when you turn on the PC\) but it is frozen and occasionally there are white artifacts in the left corner of the screen. Screen goes black again, then the same stuck loading dots again, then repeat. I actually did a clean install.

However, I am getting the my screen image blurred and it is very annoying. When i go to change the diplay, the system does not recognize my monitor and tells me that 1024 x 768 is the only resolution available with a 0 Hz refresh rate - which confirms that something is wrong here.

Hi everyone I have a sony vaio laptop VPCSB1C5E -intel i5 2nd Gen 2.5GHz -8GB RAM -Intel HD 3000 Graphics amp AMD Radeon 6600M and 6700M series My system recognizes the AMD GPU but i cant decide on what program i want to use the AMD GPU.Every program is using the Intel GPU.I tried reinstalling drivers 3 times and it didtn work.My AMD CCC just has "pinned" and "presets" tabs. Help me please. 
I am looking to switch from Xubuntu to something not debian-based, because old packets drive me crazy (I tried debian testing but it was even worse on my machine). AUR looks very promising tho, with it's new versions. I'd happily use arch but I'm afraid that I will fail the installation, as my system was hard to set up even with Xubuntu. I have a Radeon R9 280 (`VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD/ATI Tahiti PRO Radeon HD 7950/8950 OEM / R9 280 `), and I'd like Steam.

The early crashes were met with small blue and red squares covering the whole screen where as now three. So, i have this old-ish Sony Vaio laptop that uses AMD Radeon hd 7650m as dedicated video card and Intel Pentium b980 as CPU. Recently, i think my Radeon video card died, when i install any drivers for it i get flickering black screen with some artefacts and the PC is unusable unless i go in safe mode and uninstall all the drivers. This way, i can at least use the laptop for browsing internet/watching videos, but just in 1024x768 resolution. I can even play some old video games like Diablo First off all my laptop is rather old (2011). It is a sony vaio VPCSE1E1 with an Intel HD Graphics 3000 and an AMD Radeon HD 6630M. I have had a lot of trouble with the AMD graphic card not getting used. 1) When I update any drivers manually (and not through vaio) I cannot use the AMD card anymore. Doesnt matter if I update AMD drivers or intel drivers. I would love to do that because sony doesnt give out any new drivers in forever. I think the drivers I have are from dec 2011. 
I have a Sony Vaio laptop (VPCSE23FX) with AMD/Intel Hybrid graphics (AMD Seymour Radeon HD 6400M/7400M Series /Intel HD 3000). The laptop came with Windows 7, which was fine. I could use the hardware switch and change between integrated and discrete graphics, and could play games fine (I played through all of Saints Row the Third on my laptop). I jumped to Windows 10, and it never worked correctly. I was unable to get 60fps on The Binding of Isaac, let alone anything more substantial. I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1. At first everything went just fine, however two days ago weird crashes started happening. It started with weird colours in the screen ( such as this one ( ) and blue screens of death that showed errors like ''video tdr failure'' and '' video scheduler internal error''. After searching for a solution online, I gathered that the fault must be in incompatible drivers from my graphics card, so I downloaded I'm starting to plan a new computer for music production, and this will be the first time I build one myself. I've been interested in AMD's APUs, particularly the A10-7850k ( They're enticing to me since I do some light gaming and I'm a broke college kid (though, aren't we all?). But forget I just mentioned gaming since I'm focusing on Ableton Live for this build. I've heard somewhere. Hello everybody, before I get started, I wanna let you know that I am very familiar with computers. I actually had a job doing PC repair, and I'm totally comfortable doing just about everything. I just have a slightly weird problem that I want to solve, and I need some help in areas that I'm not familiar with. So I have a desktop. It's where I do 95% of all my computing, and it's decently high-end. I've got a Nvidia graphics card, SSD's, 16GB RAM, an Asrock motherboard, and an overclocked Hey so I have a Sony VAIO S Series Laptop Model (VPCSB11FX) on Windows 7 and I have a graphics driver issue. My laptop comes with switchable graphics (Integrated Intel 3000 and AMD Radeon HD 7400m) and I want to use the AMD graphics card. So I disabled my integrated intel and switched it over to the AMD one in the driver manager, however it says that theres is no driver even though in the manager it says my drivers are up to date. This makes it very confusing for me. https://gyazo.com/d99dc729b. I have a Vaio Model # VPCCB190X. I upgraded from win7 64bit pro to win8 64bit pro. Nearly everything went well after the upgrade, but I have a couple little things that are bugging me. The Netflix app doesn't work properly with the AMD/Intel drivers for my video card, (AMD Radeon 6600M) or it might be that the Intel HD Graphics card is causing Netflix to crash. Anyone have any drivers/ideas to try out? The AMD website driver detect tool appears to not work with windows8. I located newer (publish. 
I'm having some weird problems, and I was wondering if you guys could help me with them. because Sony won't, and I doubt AMD will be any help. I have a Vaio SE with a Radeon 6630m in it. It has a graphics switch that's supposed to switch between integrated to AMD graphics. The integrated graphics suck. I used it on Windows 7 for a while, and didn't have any problems until about this time last year, when I'd reinstalled windows, installed the latest drivers, and. weird things happen. Hey guys, so I'm using a Sony Vaio - VPCEL23FD. Specs: Processor name AMD Dual‐Core E‐450 APU Operating frequency 1 1.65GHz L2 Cache Size 1MB Maximum Memory Size 8 GB Memory Installed 4 GB Memory Installed composition 4GB (SO‐DIMM) x 1 Memory specification DDR3 SDRAM Memory speed 1333 MHz Integrated Graphics Accelerator Name AMD Radeon™ HD 6320 Graphics I'm having troubles actually BROWSING through webpages and i'm wondering if it's cause the laptop specs are actually shit. Hi I have a Sony VAIO SVE1413RCXB, Windows 8 64-bit, GPU is 1024MB ATI AMD Radeon HD 7500M/7600M Series My laptop shuts down while playing games like LoL or some mmo's. I've had it a year and I used to be able to play league for hours no break, but now it shuts down after just two minutes ingame. Speccy says my idling GPU temp (just browsing reddit) is in 53C-63C When playing league (or any graphic heavy game), it rapidly climbs to 90-100C+ then shuts down. I play these games on the lowest. Hey there Reddit! I'm running a Windows 7 64bit OS laptop from 2010 with PCG-91111L Model, but with a model name of VPCEC25FX when I check my VAIO control center. I've been trying this for the past year, but I cannot seem to update my graphic driver for an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470. I've tried going through AMD and Sony, but I get updated drivers that just crash during install with AMD in its Catalyst Control Center or when I try to install the ATDVID-00230054-1042.exe (the only thing sugge. My problem is with Team Fortress 2. This seems like something that was relevant a year ago at least, but I decided to try my hand at gaming. And, really, this is the only one I want to play. But I can't. The game freezes during gameplay, sometimes to the point of unplayability: -The entire game lags - audio, video and game. This happens in two specific instances: when changing weapons and when interacting with some character or object firing, getting hit, interacting with objects and scenery. When I go to "Display adapters" under device manager,it shows that I have "AMD Radeon 6600M and 6700M series" when I remember it is AMD Radeon 6630M. I tried to update the driver software,but after updating, various programmes like VLC and CCC won't open,even though it shows that I have AMD Radeon 6630M. I will then have to roll back the driver for them to work. There also use to be a Switchable Graphics option in CCC,but now there isn't. Is there a way to solve this? I have a Sony Vaio VPCCA15. Sorry if I'm missing any info that would help, or if I give stuff that isnt relevant but I'm in over my head with this sort of thing. First off I'm running Windows 8.1 64 bit on a Sony Vaio SVE14A27CXH. I have an 2.2GHZ i-7-3632QM CPU with 8GB of ram. The laptop runs a switchable grahpics set of the HD 4000 intel chip and a 2gb AMD radeon HD 7670M card. So I've hated 8.1 since its come out since it kills the AMD card. Just won't use it no matter what I do. As such I've refreshed my laptop. 
I'm having serious problems with my drivers. I own a Sony Vaio SE (VPCSE190x) with a AMD Radeon HD 6630M graphics card. The computer has a switch to turn my graphics from integrated to the Radeon chip, but that's not working right now. They're all supposed to work fine with Windows 8.1. I used it on Windows 7 for a while, and didn't have any problems until about this time last year, when I reinstalled Windows (7), installed the latest drivers, and. weird things started happening. I began. OS: Windows 7 Model: Clevo W150HNM GPU: Intel HD 3000 / Nvidia GT540M (Sandy Bridge) ---------- Hi, I'm trying to connect a 27" external monitor to my laptop. The monitor only has a DVI-D (Dual Link) input and the laptop only has VGA and HDMI out. Connecting an HD TV to the laptop via HDMI has worked fine, connecting a second monitor via VGA also worked. For this 27" monitor, I am using a cheap HDMI to DVI-D (Dual Link) cable from eBay. When I connect the cable </p>
